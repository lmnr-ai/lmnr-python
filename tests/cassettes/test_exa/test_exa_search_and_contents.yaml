        intelligence (AI) is a powerful and disruptive area of computer science, with
        the potential to fundamentally transform the practice of medicine and the
        delivery of healthcare. In this review article, we outline recent breakthroughs
        in the application of AI in healthcare, describe a roadmap to building effective,
        reliable and safe AI systems, and discuss the possible future direction of
        AI augmented healthcare systems.\\n\\n**KEYWORDS:** AI, digital health\\n\\n##
        Introduction\\n\\nHealthcare systems around the world face significant challenges
        in achieving the \u2018quadruple aim\u2019 for healthcare: improve population
        health, improve the patient's experience of care, enhance caregiver experience
        and reduce the rising cost of care. [1\u20133](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CIT0001)
        Ageing populations, growing burden of chronic diseases and rising costs of
        healthcare globally are challenging governments, payers, regulators and providers
        to innovate and transform models of healthcare delivery. Moreover, against
        a backdrop now catalysed by the global pandemic, healthcare systems find themselves
        challenged to \u2018perform\u2019 (deliver effective, high-quality care) and
        \u2018transform\u2019 care at scale by leveraging real-world data driven insights
        directly into patient care. The pandemic has also highlighted the shortages
        in healthcare workforce and inequities in the access to care, previously articulated
        by The King's Fund and the World Health Organization (Box [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#T0002)).
        [4,5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CIT0004)\\n\\n###
        Box 1.\\n\\nWorkforce challenges in the next decade\\n\\n| |\\n| --- |\\n|
        By 2030, the gap between supply of and demand for staff employed by NHS trusts
        could increase to almost 250,000 full-time equivalent posts. [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CIT0004)
        |\\n| Based on the current trends and needs of the global population by 2030,
        the world will have 18 million fewer healthcare professionals (especially
        marked differences in the developing world), including 5 million fewer doctors
        than society will require. [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CIT0005)
        |\\n\\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/table/T0002/)\\n\\nThe
        application of technology and artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare has
        the potential to address some of these supply-and-demand challenges. The increasing
        availability of multi-modal data (genomics, economic, demographic, clinical
        and phenotypic) coupled with technology innovations in mobile, internet of
        things (IoT), computing power and data security herald a moment of convergence
        between healthcare and technology to fundamentally transform models of healthcare
        delivery through AI-augmented healthcare systems.\\n\\nIn particular, cloud
        computing is enabling the transition of effective and safe AI systems into
        mainstream healthcare delivery. Cloud computing is providing the computing
        capacity for the analysis of considerably large amounts of data, at higher
        speeds and lower costs compared with historic \u2018on premises\u2019 infrastructure
        of healthcare organisations. Indeed, we observe that many technology providers
        are increasingly seeking to partner with healthcare organisations to drive
        AI-driven medical innovation enabled by cloud computing and technology-related
        transformation (Box [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#T0003)).

        chief executive officer, Microsoft: \u2018AI is perhaps the most transformational
        technology of our time, and healthcare is perhaps AI's most pressing application.\u2019
        [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CIT0006) |\\n| Tim Cook,

        |\\n| Google Health: \u2018We think that AI is poised to transform medicine,
        delivering new, assistive technologies that will empower doctors to better
        serve their patients. Machine learning has dozens of possible application
        areas, but healthcare stands out as a remarkable opportunity to benefit people.\u2019

        in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/table/T0003/)\\n\\nHere, we summarise
        recent breakthroughs in the application of AI in healthcare, describe a roadmap
        to building effective AI systems and discuss the possible future direction
        of AI augmented healthcare systems.\\n\\n## What is artificial intelligence?\\n\\nSimply
        put, AI refers to the science and engineering of making intelligent machines,
        through algorithms or a set of rules, which the machine follows to mimic human
        cognitive functions, such as learning and problem solving. [9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CIT0009)
        AI systems have the potential to anticipate problems or deal with issues as
        they come up and, as such, operate in an intentional, intelligent and adaptive
        manner. [10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CIT0010) AI's
        strength is in its ability to learn and recognise patterns and relationships
        from large multidimensional and multimodal datasets; for example, AI systems
        could translate a patient's entire medical record into a single number that
        represents a likely diagnosis. [11,12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CIT0011)
        Moreover, AI systems are dynamic and autonomous, learning and adapting as
        more data become available. [13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CIT0013)\\n\\nAI
        is not one ubiquitous, universal technology, rather, it represents several
        subfields (such as machine learning and deep learning) that, individually
        or in combination, add intelligence to applications. Machine learning (ML)
        refers to the study of algorithms that allow computer programs to automatically
        improve through experience. [14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CIT0014)
        ML itself may be categorised as \u2018supervised\u2019, \u2018unsupervised\u2019
        and \u2018reinforcement learning\u2019 (RL), and there is ongoing research
        in various sub-fields including \u2018semi-supervised\u2019, \u2018self-supervised\u2019
        and \u2018multi-instance\u2019 ML.\\n\\n- Supervised learning leverages labelled
        data (annotated information); for example, using labelled X-ray images of
        known tumours to detect tumours in new images. [15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CIT0015)\\n\\n-
        \u2018Unsupervised learning\u2019 attempts to extract information from data
        without labels; for example, categorising groups of patients with similar
        symptoms to identify a common cause. [16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CIT0016)\\n\\n-
        In RL, computational agents learn by trial and error, or by expert demonstration.
        The algorithm learns by developing a strategy to maximise rewards. Of note,
        major breakthroughs in AI in recent years have been based on RL.\\n\\n- Deep
        learning (DL) is a class of algorithms that learns by using a large, many-layered
        collection of connected processes and exposing these processors to a vast
        set of examples. DL has emerged as the predominant method in AI today driving
        improvements in areas such as image and speech recognition. [17,18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CIT0017)\\n\\n\\n##
        How to build effective and trusted AI-augmented healthcare systems?\\n\\nDespite
        more than a decade of significant focus, the use and adoption of AI in clinical
        practice remains limited, with many AI products for healthcare still at the
        design and develop stage. [19\u201322](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CIT0019)
        While there are different ways to build AI systems for healthcare, far too
        often there are attempts to force square pegs into round holes ie find healthcare
        problems to apply AI solutions to without due consideration to local context
        (such as clinical workflows, user needs, trust, safety and ethical implications).\\n\\nWe
        hold the view that AI amplifies and augments, rather than replaces, human
        intelligence. Hence, when building AI systems in healthcare, it is key to
        not replace the important elements of the human interaction in medicine but
        to focus it, and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of that interaction.
        Moreover, AI innovations in healthcare will come through an in-depth, human-centred
        understanding of the complexity of patient journeys and care pathways.\\n\\nIn
        Fig [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#F0001), we describe
        a problem-driven, human-centred approach, adapted from frameworks by Wiens
        _et al_, Care and Sendak to building effective and reliable AI-augmented healthcare
        systems. [23\u201325](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CIT0023)\\n\\n###
        Fig 1.\\n\\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/figure/F0001/)\\n\\nMulti-step,
        iterative approach to build effective and reliable AI-augmented systems in
        healthcare.\\n\\n### Design and develop\\n\\nThe first stage is to design
        and develop AI solutions for the right problems using a human-centred AI and
        experimentation approach and engaging appropriate stakeholders, especially
        the healthcare users themselves.\\n\\n#### Stakeholder engagement and co-creation\\n\\nBuild
        a multidisciplinary team including computer and social scientists, operational
        and research leadership, and clinical stakeholders (physician, caregivers
        and patients) and subject experts (eg for biomedical scientists) that would
        include authorisers, motivators, financiers, conveners, connectors, implementers
        and champions. [26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CIT0026)
        A multi-stakeholder team brings the technical, strategic, operational expertise
        to define problems, goals, success metrics and intermediate milestones.\\n\\n####
        Human-centred AI\\n\\nA human-centred AI approach combines an ethnographic
        understanding of health systems, with AI. Through user-designed research,
        first understand the key problems (we suggest using a qualitative study design
        to understand \u2018what is the problem\u2019, \u2018why is it a problem\u2019,
        \u2018to whom does it matter\u2019, \u2018why has it not been addressed before\u2019
        and \u2018why is it not getting attention\u2019) including the needs, constraints
        and workflows in healthcare organisations, and the facilitators and barriers
        to the integration of AI within the clinical context. After defining key problems,
        the next step is to identify which problems are appropriate for AI to solve,
        whether there is availability of applicable datasets to build and later evaluate
        AI. By contextualising algorithms in an existing workflow, AI systems would
        operate within existing norms and practices to ensure adoption, providing
        appropriate solutions to existing problems for the end user.\\n\\n#### Experimentation\\n\\nThe
        focus should be on piloting of new stepwise experiments to build AI tools,
        using tight feedback loops from stakeholders to facilitate rapid experiential
        learning and incremental changes. [27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CIT0027)
        The experiments would allow the trying out of new ideas simultaneously, exploring
        to see which one works, learn what works and what doesn't, and why. [28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CIT0028)
        Experimentation and feedback will help to elucidate the purpose and intended
        uses for the AI system: the likely end users and the potential harm and ethical
        implications of AI system to them (for instance, data privacy, security, equity
        and safety).\\n\\n### Evaluate and validate\\n\\nNext, we must iteratively
        evaluate and validate the predictions made by the AI tool to test how well
        it is functioning. This is critical, and evaluation is based on three dimensions:
        statistical validity, clinical utility and economic utility.\\n\\n- Statistical
        validity is understanding the performance of AI on metrics of accuracy, reliability,
        robustness, stability and calibration. High model performance on retrospective,
        _in silico_ settings is not sufficient to demonstrate clinical utility or
        impact.\\n\\n- To determine clinical utility, evaluate the algorithm in a
        real-time environment on a hold-out and temporal validation set (eg longitudinal
        and external geographic datasets) to demonstrate clinical effectiveness and
        generalisability. [25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CIT0025)\\n\\n-
        Economic utility quantifies the net benefit relative to the cost from the
        investment in the AI system.\\n\\n\\n### Scale and diffuse\\n\\nMany AI systems
        are initially designed to solve a problem at one healthcare system based on
        the patient population specific to that location and context. Scale up of
        AI systems requires special attention to deployment modalities, model updates,
        the regulatory system, variation between systems and reimbursement environment.\\n\\n###
        Monitor and maintain\\n\\nEven after an AI system has been deployed clinically,
        it must be continually monitored and maintained to monitor for risks and adverse
        events using effective post-market surveillance. Healthcare organisations,
        regulatory bodies and AI developers should cooperate to collate and analyse
        the relevant datasets for AI performance, clinical and safety-related risks,
        and adverse events. [29](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CIT0029)\\n\\n##
        What are the current and future use cases of AI in healthcare?\\n\\nAI can
        enable healthcare systems to achieve their \u2018quadruple aim\u2019 by democratising
        and standardising a future of connected and AI augmented care, precision diagnostics,
        precision therapeutics and, ultimately, precision medicine (Table [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#T0001)).
        [30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CIT0030) Research in
        the application of AI healthcare continues to accelerate rapidly, with potential
        use cases being demonstrated across the healthcare sector (both physical and
        mental health) including drug discovery, virtual clinical consultation, disease
        diagnosis, prognosis, medication management and health monitoring.\\n\\n###

        are illustrative to widescale adoption of the proposed innovation taking into
        account challenges / regulatory environment / use at scale.\\n\\nWe describe
        a non-exhaustive suite of AI applications in healthcare in the near term,
        medium term and longer term, for the potential capabilities of AI to augment,
        automate and transform medicine.\\n\\n### AI today (and in the near future)\\n\\nCurrently,
        AI systems are not reasoning engines ie cannot reason the same way as human
        physicians, who can draw upon \u2018common sense\u2019 or \u2018clinical intuition
        and experience\u2019. [12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CIT0012)
        Instead, AI resembles a signal translator, translating patterns from datasets.
        AI systems today are beginning to be adopted by healthcare organisations to
        automate time consuming, high volume repetitive tasks. Moreover, there is
        considerable progress in demonstrating the use of AI in precision diagnostics
        (eg diabetic retinopathy and radiotherapy planning).\\n\\n### AI in the medium
        term (the next 5\u201310 years)\\n\\nIn the medium term, we propose that there
        will be significant progress in the development of powerful algorithms that
        are efficient (eg require less data to train), able to use unlabelled data,
        and can combine disparate structured and unstructured data including imaging,
        electronic health data, multi-omic, behavioural and pharmacological data.
        In addition, healthcare organisations and medical practices will evolve from
        being _adopters_ of AI platforms, to becoming _co-innovators_ with technology
        partners in the development of novel AI systems for precision therapeutics.\\n\\n###
        AI in the long term (>10 years)\\n\\nIn the long term, AI systems will become
        more _intelligent_, enabling AI healthcare systems achieve a state of precision
        medicine through AI-augmented healthcare and connected care. Healthcare will
        shift from the traditional one-size-fits-all form of medicine to a preventative,
        personalised, data-driven disease management model that achieves improved
        patient outcomes (improved patient and clinical experiences of care) in a
        more cost-effective delivery system.\\n\\n### Connected/augmented care\\n\\nAI
        could significantly reduce inefficiency in healthcare, improve patient flow
        and experience, and enhance caregiver experience and patient safety through
        the care pathway; for example, AI could be applied to the remote monitoring
        of patients (eg intelligent telehealth through wearables/sensors) to identify
        and provide timely care of patients at risk of deterioration.\\n\\nIn the
        long term, we expect that healthcare clinics, hospitals, social care services,
        patients and caregivers to be all connected to a single, interoperable digital
        infrastructure using passive sensors in combination with ambient intelligence.
        [31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CIT0031) Following
        are two AI applications in connected care.\\n\\n### Virtual assistants and
        AI chatbots\\n\\nAI chatbots (such as those used in Babylon ( [www.babylonhealth.com](http://www.babylonhealth.com))
        and Ada ( [https://ada.com](https://ada.com))) are being used by patients
        to identify symptoms and recommend further actions in community and primary
        care settings. AI chatbots can be integrated with wearable devices such as
        smartwatches to provide insights to both patients and caregivers in improving
        their behaviour, sleep and general wellness.\\n\\n### Ambient and intelligent
        care\\n\\nWe also note the emergence of ambient sensing without the need for
        any peripherals.\\n\\n- Emerald ( [www.emeraldinno.com](http://www.emeraldinno.com)):
        a wireless, touchless sensor and machine learning platform for remote monitoring
        of sleep, breathing and behaviour, founded by Massachusetts Institute of Technology
        faculty and researchers.\\n\\n- Google nest: claiming to monitor sleep (including
        sleep disturbances like cough) using motion and sound sensors. [32](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CIT0032)\\n\\n-
        A recently published article exploring the ability to use smart speakers to
        contactlessly monitor heart rhythms. [33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CIT0033)\\n\\n-
        Automation and ambient clinical intelligence: AI systems leveraging natural
        language processing (NLP) technology have the potential to automate administrative
        tasks such as documenting patient visits in electronic health records, optimising
        clinical workflow and enabling clinicians to focus more time on caring for
        patients (eg Nuance Dragon Ambient eXperience ( [www.nuance.com/healthcare/ambient-clinical-intelligence.html](http://www.nuance.com/healthcare/ambient-clinical-intelligence.html))).\\n\\n\\n##
        Precision diagnostics\\n\\n### Diagnostic imaging\\n\\nThe automated classification
        of medical images is the leading AI application today. A recent review of
        AI/ML-based medical devices approved in the USA and Europe from 2015\u20132020
        found that more than half (129 (58%) devices in the USA and 126 (53%) devices
        in Europe) were approved or CE marked for radiological use. [34](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CIT0034)
        Studies have demonstrated AI's ability to meet or exceed the performance of
        human experts in image-based diagnoses from several medical specialties including
        pneumonia in radiology (a convolutional neural network trained with labelled
        frontal chest X-ray images outperformed radiologists in detecting pneumonia),
        dermatology (a convolutional neural network was trained with clinical images
        and was found to classify skin lesions accurately), pathology (one study trained
        AI algorithms with whole-slide pathology images to detect lymph node metastases
        of breast cancer and compared the results with those of pathologists) and
        cardiology (a deep learning algorithm diagnosed heart attack with a performance
        comparable with that of cardiologists). [35\u201338](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CIT0035)\\n\\nWe
        recognise that there are some exemplars in this area in the NHS (eg University
        of Leeds Virtual Pathology Project and the National Pathology Imaging Co-operative)
        and expect widescale adoption and scaleup of AI-based diagnostic imaging in
        the medium term. [39](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CIT0039)
        We provide two use cases of such technologies.\\n\\n### Diabetic retinopathy
        screening\\n\\nKey to reducing preventable, diabetes-related vision loss worldwide
        is screening individuals for detection and the prompt treatment of diabetic
        retinopathy. However, screening is costly given the substantial number of
        diabetes patients and limited manpower for eye care worldwide. [40](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CIT0040)
        Research studies on automated AI algorithms for diabetic retinopathy in the
        USA, Singapore, Thailand and India have demonstrated robust diagnostic performance
        and cost effectiveness. [41\u201344](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CIT0041)
        Moreover, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services approved Medicare reimbursement
        for the use of Food and Drug Administration approved AI algorithm \u2018IDx-DR\u2019,
        which demonstrated 87% sensitivity and 90% specificity for detecting more-than-mild
        diabetic retinopathy. [45](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CIT0045)\\n\\n###
        Improving the precision and reducing waiting timings for radiotherapy planning\\n\\nAn
        important AI application is to assist clinicians for image preparation and
        planning tasks for radiotherapy cancer treatment. Currently, segmentation
        of the images is time consuming and laborious task, performed manually by
        an oncologist using specially designed software to draw contours around the
        regions of interest. The AI-based InnerEye open-source technology can cut
        this preparation time for head and neck, and prostate cancer by up to 90%,
        meaning that waiting times for starting potentially life-saving radiotherapy
        treatment can be dramatically reduced (Fig [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#F0002)).
        [46,47](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CIT0046)\\n\\n####
        Fig 2.\\n\\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/figure/F0002/)\\n\\nPotential
        applications for the InnerEye deep learning toolkit include quantitative radiology
        for monitoring tumour progression, planning for surgery and radiotherapy planning.
        [47](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CIT0047)\\n\\n## Precision
        therapeutics\\n\\nTo make progress towards precision therapeutics, we need
        to considerably improve our understanding of disease. Researchers globally
        are exploring the cellular and molecular basis of disease, collecting a range
        of multimodal datasets that can lead to digital and biological biomarkers
        for diagnosis, severity and progression. Two important future AI applications
        include immunomics / synthetic biology and drug discovery.\\n\\n### Immunomics
        and synthetic biology\\n\\nThrough the application of AI tools on multimodal
        datasets in the future, we may be able to better understand the cellular basis
        of disease and the clustering of diseases and patient populations to provide
        more targeted preventive strategies, for example, using immunomics to diagnose
        and better predict care and treatment options. This will be revolutionary
        for multiple standards of care, with particular impact in the cancer, neurological
        and rare disease space, personalising the experience of care for the individual.\\n\\n###
        AI-driven drug discovery\\n\\nAI will drive significant improvement in clinical
        trial design and optimisation of drug manufacturing processes, and, in general,
        any combinatorial optimisation process in healthcare could be replaced by
        AI. We have already seen the beginnings of this with the recent announcements
        by DeepMind and AlphaFold, which now sets the stage for better understanding
        disease processes, predicting protein structures and developing more targeted
        therapeutics (for both rare and more common diseases; Fig [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#F0003)).

        MSA = multiple sequence alignment.\\n\\n## Precision medicine\\n\\n### New
        curative therapies\\n\\nOver the past decade, synthetic biology has produced
        developments like CRISPR gene editing and some personalised cancer therapies.
        However, the life cycle for developing such advanced therapies is still extremely
        inefficient and expensive.\\n\\nIn future, with better access to data (genomic,
        proteomic, glycomic, metabolomic and bioinformatic), AI will allow us to handle
        far more systematic complexity and, in turn, help us transform the way we
        understand, discover and affect biology. This will improve the efficiency
        of the drug discovery process by helping better predict early which agents
        are more likely to be effective and also better anticipate adverse drug effects,
        which have often thwarted the further development of otherwise effective drugs
        at a costly late stage in the development process. This, in turn will democratise
        access to novel advanced therapies at a lower cost.\\n\\n### AI empowered
        healthcare professionals\\n\\nIn the longer term, healthcare professionals
        will leverage AI in augmenting the care they provide, allowing them to provide
        safer, standardised and more effective care at the top of their licence; for
        example, clinicians could use an \u2018AI digital consult\u2019 to examine
        \u2018digital twin\u2019 models of their patients (a truly \u2018digital and
        biomedical\u2019 version of a patient), allowing them to \u2018test\u2019
        the effectiveness, safety and experience of an intervention (such as a cancer
        drug) in the digital environment prior to delivering the intervention to the
        patient in the real world.\\n\\n## Challenges\\n\\nWe recognise that there
        are significant challenges related to the wider adoption and deployment of
        AI into healthcare systems. These challenges include, but are not limited
        to, data quality and access, technical infrastructure, organisational capacity,
        and ethical and responsible practices in addition to aspects related to safety
        and regulation. Some of these issues have been covered, but others go beyond
        the scope of this current article.\\n\\n## Conclusion and key recommendations\\n\\nAdvances
        in AI have the potential to transform many aspects of healthcare, enabling
        a future that is more personalised, precise, predictive and portable. It is
        unclear if we will see an incremental adoption of new technologies or radical
        adoption of these technological innovations, but the impact of such technologies
        and the digital renaissance they bring requires health systems to consider
        how best they will adapt to the changing landscape. For the NHS, the application
        of such technologies truly has the potential to release time for care back
        to healthcare professionals, enabling them to focus on what matters to their
        patients and, in the future, leveraging a globally democratised set of data
        assets comprising the \u2018highest levels of human knowledge\u2019 to \u2018work
        at the limits of science\u2019 to deliver a common high standard of care,
        wherever and whenever it is delivered, and by whoever. [50](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CIT0050)
        Globally, AI could become a key tool for improving health equity around the
        world.\\n\\nAs much as the last 10 years have been about the roll out of digitisation
        of health records for the purposes of efficiency (and in some healthcare systems,
        billing/reimbursement), the next 10 years will be about the insight and value
        society can gain from these digital assets, and how these can be translated
        into driving better clinical outcomes with the assistance of AI, and the subsequent
        creation of novel data assets and tools. It is clear that we are at an turning
        point as it relates to the convergence of the practice of medicine and the
        application of technology, and although there are multiple opportunities,
        there are formidable challenges that need to be overcome as it relates to
        the real world and the scale of implementation of such innovation. A key to
        delivering this vision will be an expansion of translational research in the
        field of healthcare applications of artificial intelligence. Alongside this,
        we need investment into the upskilling of a healthcare workforce and future
        leaders that are digitally enabled, and to understand and embrace, rather
        than being intimidated by, the potential of an AI-augmented healthcare system.\\n\\nHealthcare
        leaders should consider (as a minimum) these issues when planning to leverage
        AI for health:\\n\\n- processes for ethical and responsible access to data:
        healthcare data is highly sensitive, inconsistent, siloed and not optimised
        for the purposes of machine learning development, evaluation, implementation
        and adoption\\n\\n- access to domain expertise / prior knowledge to make sense
        and create some of the rules which need to be applied to the datasets (to
        generate the necessary insight)\\n\\n- access to sufficient computing power
        to generate decisions in real time, which is being transformed exponentially
        with the advent of cloud computing\\n\\n- research into implementation: critically,
        we must consider, explore and research issues which arise when you take the
        algorithm and put it in the real world, building \u2018trusted\u2019 AI algorithms
        embedded into appropriate workflows.\\n\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- 1.Berwick

        One of the greatest strengths of AI in healthcare is its ability to analyze
        vast amounts of clinical data quickly, helping professionals identify disease
        markers, patient risks, and population health trends that might otherwise
        be missed.\\n\\nThe applications of artificial intelligence in healthcare
        are incredibly broad and far-reaching. AI in healthcare is already used to
        scan radiology images for early detection of cancers and heart disease, predict
        outcomes using electronic health records, and improve clinical trial design.
        By embedding artificial intelligence in healthcare into hospital systems,
        outpatient clinics, and even home monitoring devices, medical providers can
        offer smarter, faster, and more efficient care. As a result, AI in healthcare
        is widely recognized as the future of medicine, delivering better care quality
        while reducing costs and enhancing efficiency.\\n\\nThe story of artificial
        intelligence in healthcare began prominently with IBM\u2019s Watson, one of
        the earliest high-profile AI systems. In 2011, IBM launched a healthcare-specific
        version of Watson that relied on natural language processing to interpret
        and analyze medical information. This was one of the first demonstrations
        of AI in healthcare being used to improve decision-making in real-world settings.
        Today, IBM has been joined by tech giants such as Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon,
        all of whom are investing heavily in artificial intelligence in healthcare
        technologies designed to revolutionize the sector.\\n\\nThe potential of AI
        in healthcare is nothing short of remarkable. Experts predict that artificial
        intelligence in healthcare will continue to redefine how we process clinical
        data, diagnose complex conditions, develop breakthrough treatments, and even
        prevent diseases before they occur. By using AI in healthcare, physicians
        and care teams can make better-informed decisions based on accurate, real-time
        insights\u2014saving time, reducing costs, and improving patient records management.
        Whether identifying new cancer therapies, monitoring chronic disease progression,
        or improving the patient experience, artificial intelligence in healthcare
        stands as a game changer.\\n\\nLooking ahead, AI in healthcare promises to
        usher in a new era of precision medicine, where patients receive tailored
        treatment faster and more accurately than ever before. By embracing artificial

        patient outcomes while making care delivery more efficient and sustainable
        for providers. Ultimately, the future of medicine will be defined by how effectively
        we harness the power of artificial intelligence in healthcare\u2014a future
        where technology and human expertise combine to deliver unprecedented levels
        of care.\\n\\n**Let\u2019s take a look at a few of the different types of
        artificial intelligence and healthcare industry benefits that can be derived
        from their use.**\\n\\n## **Machine Learning**\\n\\n[Machine learning](https://www.foreseemed.com/blog/machine-learning-in-healthcare),
        a key component of AI used in healthcare, has significantly reshaped healthcare
        by enhancing medical diagnosis and treatment. By processing vast amounts of
        clinical data, algorithms can identify patterns and predict medical outcomes
        with unprecedented accuracy. This technology aids in analyzing patient records,
        medical imaging, and discovering new therapies, thus helping healthcare professionals
        improve treatments and reduce costs. Machine learning enables precise disease
        diagnosis, customized treatments, and detection of subtle changes in vital
        signs, which might indicate potential health issues. Precision medicine, the
        most common application, predicts effective treatment procedures based on
        patient-specific data through supervised learning. Additionally, deep learning,
        a subset of AI, is used in healthcare for tasks like speech recognition through
        natural language processing. As deep learning advances, understanding and
        utilizing it in clinical settings will become increasingly crucial for healthcare
        professionals. See our page [Benefits of Machine Learning in Healthcare](https://www.foreseemed.com/blog/machine-learning-in-healthcare)
        for more on the topic.\\n\\n## **Natural Language Processing**\\n\\n[Natural
        language processing](https://www.foreseemed.com/natural-language-processing-in-healthcare)
        (NLP) is a form of artificial intelligence that enables computers to interpret
        and use human language. This form of AI used in healthcare is reshaping the
        healthcare industry. NLP is being used in a wide range of health data applications,
        such as improving patient care through better diagnosis accuracy, streamlining
        clinical processes, and providing more personalized services.\\n\\nFor example,
        NLP can be applied to medical records to accurately diagnose illnesses by
        extracting useful information from health data. Additionally, it can be used
        to identify relevant treatments and medications for each patient or even predict
        potential health risks based on past health data. Furthermore, NLP also provides
        clinicians with powerful tools for managing large amounts of complex data
        \u2013 something which would normally take much longer to do manually.\\n\\nNatural
        language processing is proving to be an invaluable tool in healthcare \u2013
        allowing medical professionals to use artificial intelligence to more accurately
        diagnose illnesses and provide better personalized treatments for their patients.
        This form of AI in healthcare is quickly becoming a must-have in the modern
        healthcare industry and is likely to become even more sophisticated and be
        used in a wider range of applications.\\n\\n## **Rule-based Expert Systems**\\n\\nExpert
        systems based on variations of \u2018if-then\u2019 rules were the prevalent
        technology for AI in healthcare in the 80s and later periods. The use of artificial
        intelligence in healthcare is widely used for [clinical decision support](https://www.foreseemed.com/clinical-decision-support)
        to this day. Many [electronic health record systems](https://www.foreseemed.com/blog/ehr-software-and-interoperability)
        (EHRs) currently make available a set of rules with their software offerings.\\n\\nExpert
        systems usually entail human experts and engineers to build an extensive series
        of rules in a certain knowledge area. They function well up to a point and
        are easy to follow and process. But as the number of rules grows too large,
        usually exceeding several thousand, the rules can begin to conflict with each
        other and fall apart. Also, if the knowledge area changes in a significant
        way, changing the rules can be burdensome and laborious.\\n\\n## **Diagnosis
        and Treatment Applications**\\n\\nDiagnosis and treatment of disease has been
        at the core of artificial intelligence AI in healthcare for the last 50 years.
        Early rule-based systems had potential to accurately diagnose and treat disease,
        but were not totally accepted for clinical practice. They were not significantly
        better at diagnosing than humans, and the integration was less than ideal
        with clinician workflows and health record systems.\\n\\nBut whether rules-based
        or algorithmic, using artificial intelligence in healthcare for diagnosis
        and treatment plans can often be difficult to marry with clinical workflows
        and EHR systems. Integration issues into healthcare organizations has been
        a greater barrier to widespread adoption of AI in healthcare when compared
        to the accuracy of suggestions. Much of the AI and healthcare capabilities
        for diagnosis, treatment and clinical trials from medical software vendors
        are standalone and address only a certain area of care. Some EHR software
        vendors are beginning to build limited [healthcare analytics](https://www.foreseemed.com/blog/big-data-analytics-in-healthcare)
        functions with AI into their product offerings, but are in the elementary
        stages. To take full advantage of the use of artificial intelligence in healthcare
        using a stand alone EHR system providers will either have to undertake substantial
        integration projects themselves, or leverage the capabilities of third party
        vendors that have AI capabilities and can integrate with their EHR.\\n\\n##
        **Administrative Applications**\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence in healthcare
        is changing many of the administrative aspects of medical care. By automating
        mundane tasks, such as data entry, claims processing and appointment scheduling,
        using artificial intelligence in healthcare can free up time for providers
        and healthcare organizations to focus on patient care and revenue cycle management.
        Furthermore, artificial intelligence also has the potential to reduce human
        error by providing a faster way to review health records, medical imaging,
        claims processing and test results. With artificial intelligence giving medical
        professionals more autonomy over their workflow process, they are able to
        provide better quality patient care while maintaining budget efficiency. The
        ability of AI in healthcare to analyze the medical history of a patient and
        deliver better and faster results is reshaping the way healthcare providers
        deliver care, making it possible for them to devote more time and resources
        to their patients. With artificial intelligence AI in healthcare leading the
        charge in improving patient care, medical professionals can be confident that
        they can focus on delivering quality care while also saving time and money
        with AI-powered administrative tasks.\\n\\nUltimately, artificial intelligence
        in healthcare offers a refined way for healthcare providers to deliver better
        and faster patient care. By automating mundane administrative tasks, artificial
        intelligence can help medical professionals save time and money while also
        giving them more autonomy over their workflow process.\\n\\n## Regulatory,
        Ethical & Adoption Challenges\\n\\nWhile many clinicians are optimistic about
        what artificial intelligence in healthcare can achieve, patient trust often
        lags behind. Studies show that clear explanations from physicians and nurses
        improve acceptance, but transparency, strong data governance, and solid evidence
        of performance remain critical for building confidence. At the same time,
        concerns about training data, bias, fairness, and model reliability persist.
        Ensuring that AI systems do not perpetuate inequities is a growing priority,
        with initiatives like the \u201C2025 Watch List\u201D from Canadian experts
        highlighting these issues as urgent areas for attention.\\n\\nAnother challenge
        lies in liability and accountability. As artificial intelligence in healthcare
        tools take on more decision-support or even semi-autonomous roles, the question
        of responsibility becomes pressing: who is accountable if an AI-enabled recommendation
        leads to harm\u2014the clinician, the hospital, or the developer? Regulatory
        bodies are also stepping up to address these concerns. In the United States,
        for example, the FDA is formally reviewing digital mental health devices,
        while new policies are being drafted around generative AI, medical documentation
        tools, and medical device approvals. Striking the right balance between encouraging
        innovation and managing risk will be essential to ensure that artificial intelligence
        in healthcare continues to grow responsibly.\\n\\nEven when AI tools demonstrate
        strong potential, widespread implementation remains difficult. Healthcare
        organizations face challenges in integrating these systems into existing workflows,
        such as electronic health records, while also training staff, ensuring clinician
        acceptance, and demonstrating a clear return on investment. Real-world validation
        is costly but necessary for credibility. Ultimately, the success of artificial
        intelligence in healthcare will depend on overcoming these barriers\u2014building
        trust, ensuring fairness, establishing accountability, and navigating regulatory
        and financial hurdles.\\n\\n## When Did AI Become Popular in Healthcare?\\n\\nThe
        surge in popularity of healthcare AI marks a transformative era in the medical
        field. This phenomenon, gaining momentum over the past decade, has seen the
        **role of AI in healthcare** emerge as a cornerstone for innovation and efficiency
        in medical practices worldwide. Understanding when and how AI became so integral
        requires exploring its applications, benefits, and the groundbreaking examples
        of healthcare AI.\\n\\nAI in the medical field began to gain substantial attention
        in the early 21st century, with significant advancements in technology and
        data analysis. This period saw a convergence of increased computational power,
        the availability of large datasets (Big Data), and significant improvements
        in AI-powered [medical algorithms](https://www.foreseemed.com/medical-algorithms).
        The real turning point, however, came with the realization of how AI could
        address some of the most pressing challenges in healthcare, ranging from diagnostic
        accuracy to personalized treatment and operational efficiency.\\n\\nAccording
        to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1419774/ai-machine-learning-medical-device-market/#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20the%20artificial%20intelligence,11%20billion%20U.S.%20dollars%20worldwide.),
        the AI in healthcare market\u2014valued at just $11 billion in 2021\u2014is
        projected to skyrocket to nearly $187 billion by 2030. This explosive growth
        highlights the accelerating adoption of artificial intelligence in healthcare,
        signaling major transformations ahead for hospitals, medical providers, pharmaceutical
        firms, biotechnology companies, and the broader healthcare ecosystem. As investment
        scales, AI in healthcare is expected to fundamentally reshape clinical workflows,
        drug development pipelines, and patient care delivery worldwide.\\n\\n## How
        AI is Reshaping Decision-Making\\n\\nMany healthcare professionals see the
        transformative potential of artificial intelligence in healthcare, yet many
        remain cautious about its clinical use. A [2025 AMA survey](https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/digital-health/2-3-physicians-are-using-health-ai-78-2023)
        found that 66% of physicians are already using health-AI tools\u2014up from
        38% in 2023\u2014and 68% believe AI positively contributes to patient care
        in some way. But concerns are still substantial: many doctors worry about
        AI influencing diagnosis and treatment decisions, fearing errors, bias, or
        misuse.\\n\\nDespite valid concerns, the case for AI in healthcare remains
        strong: its capacity to enhance patient outcomes demands cautious optimism.
        Looking at both the strengths and limitations of artificial intelligence in
        healthcare\u2014and implementing safeguards like oversight, transparency,
        and data protection\u2014is essential to build trust among clinicians, patients,
        and healthcare institutions.\\n\\n## The Benefits of AI in Healthcare\\n\\n**How
        has AI Impacted the Health Industry?** AI for healthcare offers the ability
        to process and analyze vast amounts of medical data far beyond human capacity.
        This capability was instrumental in diagnosing diseases, predicting outcomes,
        and recommending treatments. For instance, AI algorithms can analyze medical
        images, such as X-rays and MRIs, with greater accuracy and speed than human
        radiologists, often detecting diseases such as cancer at earlier stages.\\n\\nExamples
        of artificial intelligence in healthcare are diverse and impactful. A significant
        development besides IBM\u2019s Watson Health was [Google's DeepMind Health
        project](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/codoc-developing-reliable-ai-tools-for-healthcare/),
        which demonstrated the ability to diagnose eye diseases from retinal scans
        with a level of accuracy comparable to human experts. These pioneering projects
        showcased AI's potential to revolutionize diagnostics and personalized medicine.\\n\\nAnother
        area where AI used in healthcare has made a significant impact is in [predictive
        analytics](https://www.foreseemed.com/predictive-analytics-in-healthcare).
        Healthcare AI systems can analyze patterns in a patient's medical history
        and current health data to predict potential health risks. This predictive
        capability enables healthcare providers to offer proactive, preventative care,
        ultimately leading to better patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs.\\n\\nAI
        streamlines various processes within healthcare facilities. From scheduling
        appointments to processing insurance claims, AI automation reduces administrative
        burdens, allowing healthcare providers to focus more on patient care. This
        not only improves operational efficiency but also enhances the overall patient
        experience.\\n\\nThe rise of AI in healthcare has been a gradual but steady
        journey, catalyzed by technological advancements and the increasing demand
        for improved healthcare delivery. The integration of AI into the medical field
        has brought about a paradigm shift, making healthcare more efficient, accurate,
        and personalized. As AI technology continues to evolve, its role in healthcare
        is set to become even more significant, further solidifying its status as
        an indispensable tool in modern medicine. This journey of AI from a novel
        concept to a fundamental aspect of healthcare exemplifies a technological
        revolution, with the promise of better health outcomes for all.\\n\\n## **Recent
        Advances of AI in Healthcare**\\n\\nOne of the most exciting areas of progress
        for artificial intelligence in healthcare is drug discovery. Companies like
        DeepMind, mentioned above, are pushing the frontier by dramatically shortening
        the time it takes to identify promising drug candidates. What once took years
        of research may soon take only months, with AI models accelerating the process
        of narrowing down compounds for further testing. Beyond research, AI in healthcare
        is already making a major impact on early disease detection and diagnostics.
        A new AI-powered stethoscope developed at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/)
        can detect heart failure, valve disease, and irregular rhythms in just 15
        seconds by combining ECG signals with heart sound analysis. In the UK, tools
        such as [Osiris AI](https://www.osiris-ai.co.uk/)\u2014developed in collaboration
        with Microsoft\u2014are being deployed in radiation oncology to streamline
        treatment planning. These advances highlight how artificial intelligence in
        healthcare is moving beyond experimentation and into real-world clinical applications.\\n\\nAnother
        area of rapid adoption is clinical documentation and administrative efficiency.
        Tools like [Heidi Health](https://www.heidihealth.com/) are being used to
        automate medical note-taking, transcription, and structuring, saving valuable
        time for physicians. Microsoft has also launched [Dragon Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/health-solutions/clinical-workflow/dragon-copilot),
        an AI assistant designed to reduce administrative burdens by drafting referral
        letters, after-visit summaries, and evidence-based clinical notes. This reflects
        a growing emphasis on using artificial intelligence in healthcare not only
        for diagnosis and treatment, but also for non-clinical support tasks that
        improve efficiency and reduce burnout.\\n\\nThe mental health field is also
        seeing innovation. A surge of AI-enabled tools\u2014ranging from chatbots
        to virtual therapists\u2014are entering the market. Recognizing the need for
        oversight, the U.S. FDA is preparing to evaluate these devices through its
        [Digital Health Advisory Committee](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/digital-health-center-excellence/fda-digital-health-advisory-committee)
        to weigh both their benefits and risks. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence
        in healthcare is being scaled to population-level applications. In India,
        the state of Telangana is piloting AI-based cancer screenings (oral, breast,
        cervical) to address radiologist shortages and improve early detection. In
        the UK, researchers are leveraging health datasets to develop AI models capable
        of predicting the onset of diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s and kidney disease
        years before symptoms emerge.\\n\\nFinally, cutting-edge academic work is
        expanding the boundaries of AI in healthcare through innovative approaches
        like reinforcement learning, which focuses on recommending long-term interventions
        rather than simply predicting outcomes. Other research explores embodied AI
        systems\u2014robots, multisensory platforms, and human-AI teams in diagnostics
        and pathology\u2014demonstrating that the role of artificial intelligence
        in healthcare is not confined to software tools but is expanding into interactive,
        agentive systems. Collectively, these advances show that AI is rapidly becoming
        embedded across the entire healthcare spectrum, from research labs and clinics
        to population health programs and mental health services.\\n\\n## **Emerging
        Trends & What to Watch Next**\\n\\nThe future of artificial intelligence in
        healthcare is poised to bring even greater impact, particularly in diagnosis
        and screening. We can expect further deployment of AI-powered tools\u2014such
        as imaging systems, ECG analysis, and smart stethoscopes\u2014along with expanded
        screening programs, especially in regions with limited medical resources.
        Early disease detection remains one of the most significant opportunities
        where AI in healthcare can deliver measurable value. At the same time, autonomous
        and semi-autonomous systems are on the horizon. Human-AI teaming, delegated
        autonomy, and reinforcement learning approaches will become more common, provided
        they are deployed safely and with strong regulatory oversight. Generative
        AI is also emerging as a powerful force in healthcare, supporting summarization,
        decision support, medical education, and even generating patient-facing content.
        However, concerns about accuracy, hallucinations, and safety will ensure close
        scrutiny.\\n\\nAnother critical focus will be on scaling and access. As adoption
        increases, efforts must be made to bring artificial intelligence in healthcare
        to rural and underserved communities, ensuring that its benefits are not limited
        to high-income countries or large health systems. Finally, regulatory frameworks
        will need to evolve alongside innovation. As artificial intelligence in healthcare
        becomes more powerful and pervasive, policymakers will need to formalize guidelines
        around data privacy, liability, validation, bias, and transparency to protect
        patients while fostering innovation.\\n\\nWith **new AI technology in healthcare**,
        tools like [ForeSee Medical](https://www.foreseemed.com) and intelligent algorithms
        now possess the ability to interpret massive datasets at unprecedented speeds.
        Advanced deep learning systems can detect diseases earlier, craft individualized
        treatment strategies, and even automate complex tasks, such as certain aspects
        of drug discovery. These leaps forward can improve patient safety, reduce
        operational costs, and elevate the overall standard of care.\\n\\nThe promise
        of AI in healthcare extends into the future, where connected digital ecosystems
        and powerful analytics engines will reshape our understanding of health and
        disease. However, the primary challenge is not AI\u2019s inherent capability
        to excel, but rather the integration of these tools into everyday clinical
        practice. As providers adapt, roles in medicine may shift to emphasize the
        uniquely human talents of empathy, complex reasoning, and nuanced judgment.
        Those who embrace AI will likely reap the greatest rewards, as new generations
        of clinicians and patients alike benefit from improved outcomes, heightened
        efficiency, and better overall experiences.\\n\\nIn short, AI in healthcare
        holds tremendous potential, with emerging technologies heralding a new era
        of medical innovation. Through careful adoption, robust evidence generation,
        ethical oversight, and ongoing education, we can fully harness AI\u2019s transformative
        power to improve lives, streamline clinical workflows, and usher in a future
        defined by patient-centered, data-driven healthcare.Are you looking to extract
